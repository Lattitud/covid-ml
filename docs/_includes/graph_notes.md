_Notes:_

* The underlying python code used to generate the graphs can be accessed in the form of a Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/paulknewton/covid-ml/blob/master/covid.ipynb). Github will show this as HTML, but it is not updated dynamically. [This HTML version of the notebook](covid.html) is updated hourly.
* All graphs are updated on an hourly basis, but the underlying data files from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu) are only updated daily (more details [here](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data-collection)).
