Note how the gradients of the curves - indicating the infection/mortality rates - vary across countries. For example, Italy and Spain have broadly similar numbers of infections, but when scaled as as fraction of the underyling populations, the Spanish infection rate is rather higher. Note also how the gradient of the curves differ: the infection was slower to take hold in Spanish (or at least, as reflected in the recorded figures), but quickly accelerated to match Italy.
