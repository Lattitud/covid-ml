All governments are aiming to keep the peak of the curve as low as possible to reduce the numbers of infections and overall deaths. However, the shape of the curve is key to understanding the spread of the virus and project the evolution. Much of the news coverage talks of 'flattenning the curve' in order to:

* Maintain the number of new infections within the capacity of the health service in order to increase the likelihood of recovery
* Determine the most appropriate measures to put in place and when these can be adapted. For example, severe social distancing measures (lockdowns) can only be relaxed once the curve has shown to be notably flattening.

As the rate of infection decreases, the curves starts to flatten (eventually flattenning completely as no new cases are discovered). Note how the gradients of the curves - indicating the rates of new infections/deaths - vary across countries. This may be due to many reasons (more effective policies, differences in health case and health system capacity, differences in demographics etc).
