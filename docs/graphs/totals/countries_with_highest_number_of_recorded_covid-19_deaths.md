Figures for COVID-19 deaths may be more accurate than those of infections (due to the significant under-counting of infections for the reasons cited above). However:

* Policies for recording COVID-19 deaths are not consistent across countries. Some countries record any the death in the COVID statistics if the deceased had contracted COVID-19 while other countries only record the death if the COVID-19 was deemed to be the underlying cause.
* Conversely, it is generally accepted that people will be dying due to COVID-related causes but will not be tested retroactively to classify this as a COVID-19 death.
