## Graphs

Graphs and analyses relating to the COVID-19 pandemic are organised into categories to simplify navigation:

![bar-chart](https://img.icons8.com/cotton/64/000000/bar-chart--v2.png) | [Graphs showing cumulative statistics: total infections & deaths over time, top 20 hotpots, Case Fatality Risks etc](totals)
![line-chart](https://img.icons8.com/cotton/64/000000/positive-dynamic.png) | [Graphs showing rates change in COVID-19 infections & mortality rates](rates)
![countries](https://img.icons8.com/cotton/64/000000/flag-2.png) | [Country-specific graphs](countries)

The underlying python code used to generate the graphs can be accessed in the form of a Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/paulknewton/covid-ml/blob/master/covid.ipynb).

Github will show this as HTML, but it is not updated dynamically. [This HTML version of the notebook](covid.html) is updated hourly.

Note: the graphs are updated on an hourly basis, but the underlying data files from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu) are only updated daily (more details [here](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data-collection)).
