This metric calculates the proportion of deaths compared to the recorded cases. It describes the likelihood of a COVID-19 infection being fatal.

* While this removes the bias against population sizes, the figures are still subject to the same issues relating from the recording of the raw data (level of testing; classification of death as COVID-related etc). Unlike the Infection Fatality Rate, these graphs only use recorded cases and do not try to take account of undiagnosed cases.

* The majority of top countries are under-developed nations. This may indicate limitations in the health care systems (where a COVID infection has an increased risk of a fatality), and/or be a result of more limited testing programmes (which reduce the number of recorded infections).

* More generally, there is agreement that the numbers of recorded infections is significantly lower than the actual infections. In these cases, the CFR metric should be treated with caution (currently over 5% worldwide). This is likely to be significantly higher than the real Infection Fatality Rate (which estimates the actual numbers of infections).
