These graphs show the rise of the virus over its lifetime. The peak of each curve is when the virus is spreading fastest through a population. The fall of the curve is when the virus is slowing down and reaching the end of its spread.

* These derivative curves show more clearly the rate at which the virus is spreading. Temporary decreases often give offer a false hope and the infection rate soon returns to previously higher levels. This may be due to changes in the spread of the virus, delayed reporting of cases over weekends etc.

* The shape of the curve generally follows a bell-curve shape, but there is concern that the peak starts to plateau over a prolonged period before dropping. However, the virus appears to be clearly slowing down in some countries (e.g. Austria).

* There is a fear over the longer term that the infection rate may rise again as social distancing measures are relaxed (a so-called "2nd wave").
