This project analyses publicly available data on the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies trends and patterns using the pandas data analysis framework.

* The project is written as a Jupyter notebook using pandas [here](https://github.com/paulknewton/covid-ml/blob/master/covid.ipynb). Github will render a static version if you click on this. If you want to execute the notebook dynamically, you will need to download it locally (see [instructions below](#installation)).
* A HTML version is updated on an hourly basis [here](https://paulknewton.github.io/covid-ml/covid.html)
* A basic dashboard only including main graphs is updated hourly [here](https://paulknewton.github.io/covid-ml/)

## Installation
If you want to modify the graphs and python code yourself, refer to the installation and usage instructions [in the git repository](https://github.com/paulknewton/covid-ml)
